Use GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication in workflows
Learn how to use the GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate on behalf of GitHub Actions.

In this article
This tutorial leads you through how to use the GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication in GitHub Actions workflows, including examples for passing the token to actions, making API requests, and configuring permissions for secure automation.

For reference information, see Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions.

Using the GITHUB_TOKEN in a workflow
You can use the GITHUB_TOKEN by using the standard syntax for referencing secrets: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}. Examples of using the GITHUB_TOKEN include passing the token as an input to an action, or using it to make an authenticated GitHub API request.

Important

An action can access the GITHUB_TOKEN through the github.token context even if the workflow does not explicitly pass the GITHUB_TOKEN to the action. As a good security practice, you should always make sure that actions only have the minimum access they require by limiting the permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN. For more information, see Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions.

Example 1: passing the GITHUB_TOKEN as an input
This example workflow uses the GitHub CLI, which requires the GITHUB_TOKEN as the value for the GH_TOKEN input parameter:

YAML
name: Open new issue
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  open-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
    steps:
      - run: |
          gh issue --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
            create --title "Issue title" --body "Issue body"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Example 2: calling the REST API
You can use the GITHUB_TOKEN to make authenticated API calls. This example workflow creates an issue using the GitHub REST API:

name: Create issue on commit

on: [ push ]

jobs:
  create_issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Create issue using REST API
        run: |
          curl --request POST \
          --url https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues \
          --header 'authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}' \
          --header 'content-type: application/json' \
          --data '{
            "title": "Automated issue for commit: ${{ github.sha }}",
            "body": "This issue was automatically created by the GitHub Action workflow **${{ github.workflow }}**. \n\n The commit hash was: _${{ github.sha }}_."
            }' \
          --fail
Modifying the permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN
Use the permissions key in your workflow file to modify permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN for an entire workflow or for individual jobs. This allows you to configure the minimum required permissions for a workflow or job. As a good security practice, you should grant the GITHUB_TOKEN the least required access.

To see the list of permissions available for use and their parameterized names, see Managing your personal access tokens.

The two workflow examples earlier in this article show the permissions key being used at the job level.

Granting additional permissions
If you need a token that requires permissions that aren't available in the GITHUB_TOKEN, create a GitHub App and generate an installation access token within your workflow. For more information, see Making authenticated API requests with a GitHub App in a GitHub Actions workflow. Alternatively, you can create a personal access token, store it as a secret in your repository, and use the token in your workflow with the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens and Using secrets in GitHub Actions.

Granting additional permissions
If you need a token that requires permissions that aren't available in the GITHUB_TOKEN, create a GitHub App and generate an installation access token within your workflow. For more information, see Making authenticated API requests with a GitHub App in a GitHub Actions workflow. Alternatively, you can create a personal access token, store it as a secret in your repository, and use the token in your workflow with the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax. For more information, see Managing your personal access tokens and Using secrets in GitHub Actions.

Use GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication in workflows
Learn how to use the GITHUB_TOKEN to authenticate on behalf of GitHub Actions.

In this article
This tutorial leads you through how to use the GITHUB_TOKEN for authentication in GitHub Actions workflows, including examples for passing the token to actions, making API requests, and configuring permissions for secure automation.

For reference information, see Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions.

Using the GITHUB_TOKEN in a workflow
You can use the GITHUB_TOKEN by using the standard syntax for referencing secrets: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}. Examples of using the GITHUB_TOKEN include passing the token as an input to an action, or using it to make an authenticated GitHub API request.

Important

An action can access the GITHUB_TOKEN through the github.token context even if the workflow does not explicitly pass the GITHUB_TOKEN to the action. As a good security practice, you should always make sure that actions only have the minimum access they require by limiting the permissions granted to the GITHUB_TOKEN. For more information, see Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions.

Example 1: passing the GITHUB_TOKEN as an input
This example workflow uses the GitHub CLI, which requires the GITHUB_TOKEN as the value for the GH_TOKEN input parameter:

YAML
name: Open new issue
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  open-issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      issues: write
    steps:
      - run: |
          gh issue --repo ${{ github.repository }} \
            create --title "Issue title" --body "Issue body"
        env:
          GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
Example 2: calling the REST API
You can use the GITHUB_TOKEN to make authenticated API calls. This example workflow creates an issue using the GitHub REST API:

name: Create issue on commit

on: [ push ]

jobs:
  create_issue:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      issues: write
    steps:
      - name: Create issue using REST API
        run: |
          curl --request POST \
          --url https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues \
          --header 'authorization: Bearer ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}' \
          --header 'content-type: application/json' \
          --data '{
            "title": "Automated issue for commit: ${{ github.sha }}",
            "body": "This issue was automatically created by the GitHub Action workflow **${{ github.workflow }}**. \n\n The commit hash was: _${{ github.sha }}_."
            }' \
          --fail
Modifying the permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN
Use the permissions key in your workflow file to modify permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN for an entire workflow or for individual jobs. This allows you to configure the minimum required permissions for a workflow or job. As a good security practice, you should grant the GITHUB_TOKEN the least required access.

To see the list of permissions available for use and their parameterized names, see Managing your personal access tokens.

The two workflow examples earlier in this article show the permissions key being used at the job level.

Granting additional permissions
If you need a token that requires permissions that aren't available in the GITHUB_TOKEN, create a GitHub App and generate an installation access token within your workflow. For more information, see Making authenticated API requests with a GitHub App in a GitHub Actions workflow. Alternatively, you can create a personal access token, store it as a secret in your repository, and use the token in your workflow with the ${{ secrets.SECRET_NAME }} syntax.
